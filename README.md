## Hi there 👋
```
Majority of the repositories that i will be working on is on my open source repository
organization called Defer Studios
I will be focusing on coding these applications in the repository organization
In my newest projects but any projects in my main github account will be
worked on but will work on till
I am satisfied with the code quality and applications functions
```
**Current Goal**
```shell
rewrite the entire codebases of every github project you made without any AI related assistance
this is a task i shall do until i am satisfied with every thing
once its done i shall take a break from writing software and do more game development related work 
```
- Feel free to check out the repository organization **https://github.com/devgithub-sl**
- I would love your feedback and comments and even code fixes if possible :)
- Thank you have a nice day :)
