## Hi there 👋
```
Majority of the repositories that i will be working on is on my open source repository organization called Defer Studios, i will be focusing on coding these applications in the repository organization
in my newest projects but any projects in my main github account will be worked on but will work on till it i am satisfied with the code quality and applications functions.
```
